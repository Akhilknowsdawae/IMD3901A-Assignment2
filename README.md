• Overview of what you did (i.e. what are the controls? Why this design?)
I attempted to create a blacksmith area. It contains a metal casting area, a forge, an anvil, a grinder and display table.

• What was challenging?
I've had trouble coding out the destruction of objects with requirements. I've tried to code a javascript file (forge-logic.js) that deletes an ingot if you bring it near the forge and increament a variable, 
but I couldn't get that to work. 

• What went well (i.e. how did you solve the above challenges?).
I was able to create logic for casting metals via button interaction with a slow change from a molten plane into spawning 2 ingots.
As well as item pickup which auto rotates the ingot into its inital rotation when placed back down.
